Rachel is a trained environmental scientist, currently finishing her degree at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management with a focus on coastal marine resource management and stategic environmental communication. 

In her free time, Rachel can be found out in the Santa Barbara channel with a camera in hand as she aims to capture the liminal, the in-between, the moving and porous boundary between earth, air, and water. Some of her prints can be purchased at the print shop link below.
