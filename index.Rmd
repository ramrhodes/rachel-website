Rachel was discovered floating on a mat of giant kelp in the Santa Barbara channel with no memory of how she got there or where she came fromâ€”the only things that were certain were her strong connection to the ocean, her desire to protect it, and a strict filter feeding diet of plankton. She is a trained environmental scientist, finishing her degree at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.
