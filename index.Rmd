Rachel was discovered floating on a mat of giant kelp in the Santa Barbara channel with no memory of how she got there or where she came fromâ€”the only things that were certain were her strong connection to the ocean, her desire to protect it, and a strict filter feeding diet of plankton. She is a trained environmental scientist, finishing her degree at UC Santa Barbara's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management with a focus on coastal marine resource management and strategic environmental communication. In her free time, Rachel can be found out in the ocean with a camera in hand as she aims to capture the liminal, the in-between, the moving and porous boundary between earth, air, and water.
