The following analysis explores using nonlinear least squares to find parameter estimates of the increase in global wild fish catch from 1950 - 2012 using data from U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization.

**Data Citation** Global wild fish catch and aquaculture production, compiled by Earth Policy Institute with 1950-2010 from U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Global Capture Production and Global Aquaculture Production, electronic databases, at www.fao.org/fishery/topic/16140/en.

## Data Wrangling

#### Data Cleanup
Read in and clean up data:
```{r}
fish <- read_csv("fish_catch.csv") %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename(year = world_wild_fish_catch_and_farmed_fish_production_1950_2012, 
        wild = x2,
        farmed_fish = x3,
        total_fish = x4) %>% 
  slice(5:67)%>% 
  mutate(time = 0:62) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as.numeric)  %>% 
  select(year, wild, time)
```

---

#### Visual Exploration
Now, let's graph this to explore the relationship between wild catch over time. 


```{r}
ggplot(data = fish, aes(x = time, y = wild)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(x = "time(years)", y = "wild catch (millions of tonnes)")
```


We can see in the figure the shape sort of looks like a **logistic growth model**, which means the per capita growth rate gets smaller as the catch size approaches the carrying capacity ($K$). 

This is mathematically expressed as:

$P(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-rt}}$ 

where $K$ is the carrying capacity, $A$ is $\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}$ and $r$ is the growth rate constant.

## Nonlinear Least Squares Model

To find the parameters for a logistic growth equation we will use nonlinear leas squares (NLS) to find parameter estimates that minimizes the sum of squares of residuals using the common iterative algorithm Guass-Newtown to do this. There are a few  steps we will do to create this model. 


#### Step 1. Find the initial estimates for parameters

To find the inital parameters for a logistic growth equation ($r$. $K$, $A$) first lets find an initial estimate for growth rate constant ($r$):

$P(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-rt}}$ 

To estimate $r$ during the exponential growth phase, lets look at time < 35 since beyond 35 the curve starts to level off. We can then take the natural log and find the slope of log-transformed exponential growth phase to give us an estimate for $r$. 

Filter data to observations between year 0 and 35 and take the natural log:

```{r}
fish_exp <- fish %>% 
  filter(time < 35) %>% 
  mutate(ln_catch = log(wild))
```

To get the estimate for $r$, we then find the slope of the linear equation:

```{r}
lm_k <- lm(ln_catch ~ time, data = fish_exp)

lm_k

# coefficient is ~0.04
```

ased on our linear model, our initial estimate for $r$ is 0.04. Looking at the graph, we can determine our initial estimate for $K$ is ~85 and an initial estimate for $A$ using is $\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}$ which is ~ 4. 

Now that we have these we will use them as starting points in an iterative algorithm to converge on parameter estimates.

#### Step 2. Create nonlinear least squares (NLS) model

To create the NLS model:

```{r}
fish_nls <- nls(wild ~ K/(1+ A*exp(-r*time)),
                data = fish,
                start = list(K = 85, A = 4, r = 0.04),
                trace = TRUE
                )
```

Let's put the output of the model into a table:

```{r}
fish_output <- broom::tidy(fish_nls)

fish_output %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  fmt_number(
    columns = vars(estimate, std.error, statistic),
    decimals = 2
  ) %>% 
  tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Units in millions of tonnes",
    locations = cells_body(
      columns = vars(term),
      rows = 1:2)
  )
```


---

### Step 3. Make predictions

We can use the estimated parameters to make predictions. Our model with estimated parameters is:
$$P(t) = \frac{100}{1+4.316e^{-0.07t}}$$


Now, we can create predictions for the wild catch over the same time periods & calculate the confidence interval:

```{r}
# make predictions 
fish_predict <- predict(fish_nls)

# create data frame that includes both the original data frame and the new predictions
fish_complete <- data.frame(fish, fish_predict)

# find confidence intervals
fish_ci <- confint2(fish_nls)

fish_ci
```

---

#### Step 4. Create graphs and tables of outputs

The graph below shows the original data and the predictions from our model output:

```{r}
ggplot(data = fish_complete, aes(x = time, y = wild)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x = time, y = fish_predict)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Increase in global wild fish catch from 1950 - 2012", 
       x = "time",
       y = "wild fish catch (millions of tonnes)")
```


We can also create a table that shows our predictions:

```{r}
fish_complete %>% 
  select(year, wild, fish_predict) %>% 
  gt() %>% 
  tab_header(
    title = "Global Wild Fish Catch 1950 - 2012", subtitle = "Comparison of actual and predicted fish catch in millions of tonnes") %>%
  fmt_number(
    columns = vars(wild, fish_predict),
    decimals = 0
  ) %>% 
  cols_label(
    year = "Year",
    wild = "Actual Wild Catch",
    fish_predict = "Predicted Wild Catch"
  ) 
  
```
